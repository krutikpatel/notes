AWS notes
==============
Elastic beanstalk is more suitable for webapps/application deployements
-it has more fascilities on top of EC2

IMP:
whatever we create on AWS is local/specific to that region, so make sure u r in same region everytime.

-if deploy using jar, use Java
-if deploy using war, use tomcat as type of application.

-create billing notifications on AWS 
-create IAM user role to do all work, and leave root untouched after creating IAM user/role 

-EC2 eastic IP is what we use, plublic IP will keep changing

-Each application can have multiple environments where u can deploy it. eg: dev qa


aws dev associate.
